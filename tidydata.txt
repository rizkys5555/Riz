1. Rows (Observations)
The file contains 180 rows. This is because there are 30 subjects (participants) and 6 activities (WALKING, SITTING, etc.) for each..

2. Columns (Variables)
Each row includes several columns that follow the tidy data principle:

    Subject: An identifier (1–30) for the person who performed the activity.
    Activity: The descriptive name of the activity (e.g., WALKING).
    Averages of Measurements: The rest of the columns (usually around 66 to 79) contain the average value for each mean and standard deviation measurement from the original dataset.

3. Example Snippet
If you open the file, it will look like this (simplified):
subject	activity	TimeBodyAccelerometer-mean()-X	TimeBodyAccelerometer-std()-Y	...
1	WALKING	0.277	-0.017	...
1	SITTING	0.221	-0.040	...
2	WALKING	0.276	-0.018	...
4. Technical Format

    Space-delimited: The values are typically separated by spaces.
    Header included: The first line contains the variable names.
    No row names: As per the instructions (row.name=FALSE), there are no numbering labels at the start of each line.
